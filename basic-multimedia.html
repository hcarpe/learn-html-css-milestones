  <p>Below is a bootlegged video and audio I stripped from a song I liked that was removed from all streaming platforms a long time ago.</p>
  <p>I don't have credentials to cite with, but the song is "Never Told you" by Oscar! You should check him out, even though he removed this bop from streaming platforms his newer music is amazing too.</p>
  <br>
  <p>The video:</p>
