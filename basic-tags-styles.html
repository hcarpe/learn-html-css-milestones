  <h1>A List of Basic HTML Tags:</h1>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <section id = "paragraph">

        <h2>Paragraph Tags</h2>
          <p>The paragraph tag is used to separate different paragraphs in an HTML document's text</p>
          <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_p.asp" target="_blank">Learn more about paragraph tags here!</a>
          <!-- I know this doesn't look uniform compared to the rest of the website, but I needed to change the text color
          so I did this structure instead for this tag. -->

      </section>
    </li>
    <li>
      <section id = "blockquote">

        <h2><a href="https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_blockquote.asp" target="_blank">Blockquote Tags</a></h2>
          <p>The blockquote tag is used to add blockquotes to an HTML document.</p>
            <blockquote class="chcolor" cite="https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_blockquote.asp">Blockquotes are usually indented and specifies a section that is quoted from another source.</blockquote>
          <p>Text usually surrounds blockquotes, and you need to provide the source of the quote using the blockquote cite attribute within the tag. You can find the source by inspecting the blockquote element from the browser.</p>

      </section>
    </li>
    <li>
      <section id = "pre" class="borders">

        <h2><a href="https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_pre.asp" target="_blank">Pre-Formatted Text Tags</a></h2>
          <p>Other tags don't usually doesn't preserve white space, but the pre tag preserves white space and line breaks in text.</p>
          <pre class="chcolor">See, I   am   putting   more   than   one   space   between   the   words   and   a   line   break   here:
            and   the   pre   tag   preserves   it!</pre>
          <p>If   I   do   this   under   the   paragraph   tag   (which   I   am   right   now),   it   isn't   preserved
            and   you   can't   see   it.</p>

      </section>
    </li>
    <li>
      <section id = "iem">

        <h2><a href="https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_i.asp" target="_blank">i</a> and <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_em.asp" target="_blank">Em</a> Tags</h2>
          <p>The em and i tags are pretty much the same in regular browsers. However, there is a key difference.</p>
          <p class="chcolor"><i>I stands for italic, and looks like this. I is simply used to emphasize text to the naked eye, something a blind person might not understand if they were having the text read to them.</i></p>
          <p class="chcolor"><em>Em, on the other hand, stands for emphasize, and looks like this. Em is used in order to indicate how text should be understood. The em tag will manifest itself in different ways, such as sounding different in an interpreter software for blind people.</em></p>

    <li>
      <section id = "bstrong">

        <h2><a href="https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_b.asp" target="_blank">b</a> and <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_strong.asp" target="_blank">Strong</a> Tags</h2>
          <p>Much like em and i, b and strong may look the same but have a key difference.</p>
          <p class="chcolor"><b>B stands for bold and looks like this. It is only used to make text bold to the naked eye.</b></p>
          <p class="chcolor"><strong>Strong looks like this and indicates how text should be understood. Like em, strong text might be read differently in interpreter software.</strong></p>
