<!DOCTYPE html> <!-- This tag assigns the doc to be HTML -->
<html lang="en"> <!-- This tag assigns the doc's language as English -->
<head> <!-- This is the header tag and contains the title as well as style tags -->
  <title>Basic Snippet</title> <!-- This is where the title of the webpage goes -->
</head>
<body> <!-- This is where all of the text in the webpage goes -->

  <p>
  <!-- This is a paragraph tag. This tag is a child of the body tag because it is of less value in the tag hierarchy so it has to go one step behind. -->
    Want to search the web?
    Try  <a href="https://google.com" id="the-best-link" class="banana"  target="_blank">Google</a>!
    <!-- This is a hyperlinlink tag to add clickeable links to a document. The target attribute with the "_blank" value opens the link in a different tab.
    The id with value "the-best-link" and class with value "banana" are ways for the coder to identify the tag when they want to edit it using CSS. The id
    tag is more specific than the class tag.-->

  </p> <!-- Most attributes end with the same tag except a "/" goes in front of it. This is to let the computer know that the tag has been closed and should
  not be used anymore, i.e in this case that the paragraph is finished and a new paragraph/whatever else the coder wants to put after it can be opened below-->
