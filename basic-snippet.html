  <p>Now, read the explanations about the snippet's tags below:</p>
  <ul>
  <li>The first thing to be done at the top of the HTML document is type !DOCTYPE html. This lets the operating system know it should interpreter
  the code as HTML rather than another language. Find more info about the DOCTYPE tag <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_doctype.asp" target="_blank">here!</a></li>
  <li>Then, you assign the HTML document's language by typing html lang=, and then the language in quotations. For example, you would type html lang="en" if you are coding in English. <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_html.asp" target="_blank">Here</a> is more info on how to assign the language to an HTML document.</li>
  <li>You use the head tag for metadata or data about the data. I let the broswer know to read the HTML in UTF-8 format by typing meta charset="UTF-8". I also gave the tab a title by typing "Basic Snippet" in between the <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_title.asp" target="_blank">title tags.</a> The header is also where you put any CSS into the document between style tags. Find more info about the head tag <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_head.asp" target="_blank">here!</a></li>
  <li>After the head tag is closed, you can open the body tag. The body tag is where all of the text and other visible elements of a webpage will be coded. <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_body.asp" target="_blank">Here</a> is more info about the body tag!</li>
  <li>The break tag is typed as <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_br.asp" target="_blank">br</a>, and indicates a line break in the text.</li>
  <li>The a tag is a hyperlinlink tag and adds clickeable links to a document. The target attribute with the "_blank" value opens the link in a different tab.
  The id with value "the-best-link" and class with value "banana" are ways for the coder to identify the tag when they want to edit it using CSS. The id
  tag is more specific than the class tag. Find more info <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_a.asp" target="_blank">here!</a></li>
  <li> p and /p are used in order to separate paragraphs of text. Find more info <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_p.asp" target="_blank">here!</a></li>
  <li>In the case of the snippet, the paragraph tag is a child of the body tag because it is of less value in the tag hierarchy. Because of this, the paragraph tag
    goes one indentation (two spaces) behind the body.</li>
  <li>Also note that most attributes end with the same tag except a "/" goes in front of it. This is to let the computer know that the tag has been closed and should
  not be used anymore, i.e in this case that the paragraph is finished and a new paragraph/whatever else the coder wants to put after it can be opened below</li>
